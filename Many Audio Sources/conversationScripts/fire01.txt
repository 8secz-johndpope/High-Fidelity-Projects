This fire...it's so warm!
Kimberly
Who built this thing? I must have been across the island when someone built it.
Justin
I think it was Ivy.
Ivy
It was me! I learned how to build fires in Girl Scouts so many years ago.
Amy
No wonder your technique is so good!
Kimberly
Well thank you, Ivy!
Ivy
No problem, my friends. Geraint, did you remember the marshmallows?
Geraint
Oh, crap. I think I left them on the boat.
Justin
You mean the boat way out in the distance there?
Geraint
Yeah, I mean that boat. There is no way that I'm going to swim all the way back out there just to get the marshmallows.
Kimberly
I'll do it.
Aditi
Really?
Kimberly
No way!
Justin
You always were the jokester, Kimberly.
Ivy
Geraint, I think you need to go find some marshmallows.
Geraint
Where am I going to find marshmallows on this island?
Aditi
It's OK, we'll just eat toasted graham crackers instead.
Ivy
I'm fine with this, since it's our only option.
Geraint
Sorry, everyone. Great fire, though!

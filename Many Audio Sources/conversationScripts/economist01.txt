Brian
Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to meet Dr. Edward Smith.
Joey
It's nice to meet you, Dr. Smith.
Emma
Pleasure to meet you too.
Brian
Dr. Smith is an economist. She just finished writing a book on international trade.
Joey
Oh? That's my field, too. I work for the United Nations.
Emma
In the development program, by chance?
Joey
Yes, how did you guess?
Emma
I've read your articles on technical assistance. They're excellent.
Joey
Oh, thank you! Well, what was it like writing your book?
Emma
Oh, it was a challenge.
Brian
She says that, but it barely needed any revision.
Emma
You are too kind, Joe.
